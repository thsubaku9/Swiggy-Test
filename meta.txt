Write a data generator that can generate the realistic data for each of the tables above.
A min of 1000 users and 10K orders. The data shouldn't be completely random. For
example:
a. lat,lng values should not be random doubles but actual lat,lng values. It is okay
to use an open source project / scripts (example) to generate this data. Just
reference it in the code.
b. GST values shouldnâ€™t be larger than actual price. It should be a fraction (say
18%) of actual price.
c. The data should be written to the local file system.
